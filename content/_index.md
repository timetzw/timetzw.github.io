# About Me
Hi! 
I am a 1st year Computer Science Ph.D. student at **Duke University** advised by [Professor Matthew Lentz](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~mlentz/). My research interests include operating systems and security.

During my undergraduate degree at **Columbia University**, I had the privilege of working with [Professor Jason Nieh](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nieh/) to extend the Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture IMA to containers without requiring changes to the kernel using eBPF. 

Additionally, I had the opportunity to work [Professor Hod Lipson](https://www.hodlipson.com/) in the Creative Machines Lab to design and build software for a 3D food printer.
