**Container IMA using eBPF advised by Professor Jason Nieh, Columbia University**

The ability to measure and monitor the integrity of containers running on the system fills a gap in observability, trust, and security. However, the mechanism in the Linux kernel for measuring integrity within a system, Integrity Measurement Architecture IMA, does not support Linux containers. This project leverages the kernel's existing support of eBPF to extend the Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture to containers without changes to the host operating system. \
